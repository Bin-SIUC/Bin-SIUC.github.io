  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I am an Assistant Professor at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (since 2023). I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech in 2019 (Advisor: Robert G. Parker) and was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Utah (2019–2022).</p>
  <p>My research integrates group theory, nonlinear vibrations, and machine learning (e.g., physics-informed neural networks) to analyze and control complex mechanical systems. Current interests include symmetry-based modal analysis for multi-stage/periodic structures, wave energy power take-off mechanisms, and symmetry-aware design and topology optimization for additive manufacturing.</p>
